        <br>
        As an additional incentive to the benefits of the challenge itself, all who  participated were entered into a raffle for a SpaFinder gift certificate and  other prizes! <br>
        <br>
        The winner of our Grand Prize Winner is Nechama S.,  Occupational Therapist, mother 5 children under age 11! Nechama  &lsquo;unplugs and reconnects&rsquo; by taking a few days off before school starts and  spending it with her family. Congratulations Nechama and enjoy the $400  SpaFinder Gift Certificate! <br>
        <br>
        Other winners included Sarah B., CSW;&nbsp;Heather  W., OT, Alan T., Health Aide, and Emily E., SLP who each received $25  Continuing Education Gift Certificate as well as a $25 Target Gift Card.
