      This course presents practical, successful treatment strategies based on current research on the visual vestibular system and the role it plays in development and daily function. Participants will learn to identify signs of visual/vestibular dysfunction, the role of behavioral vision treatment as it relates to your therapy treatment and when to refer clients for vision therapy. They will learn theory, assessment and treatment and how to develop effective treatment protocols for the clinic and school with measurable goals. Treatment and case study videos are presented with a multidisciplinary understanding for improved outcomes. While the majority of the films and case studies are of children, we have also applied these treatments to adults with great success. Patient population includes: TBI, ADD, autism, developmental disabilities, and learning disabilities as well as other developmental issues.</p>
