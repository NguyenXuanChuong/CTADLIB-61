            DESCRIPTION:</span><br />
            This course focuses on working with children who have been diagnosed with and identified as having auditory processing
            disorders (APD). Divided into three parts, it includes a. A brief overview of how different professions define
            auditory processing and a presentation of Dr. Lucker&rsquo;s systems integrative approach; b. Appropriate assessment methods
            with a focus on a screening tool that is successful, simple and can be used by any professional and accommodations
            available to children with APD; c. Treatment strategies and activities.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="style4">Participants will be able to:<br />
          &bull; Identify the five systems that account for how we process auditory information<br />
          &bull; Identify each of the seven categories of APD and one specific skill needed in each category<br />
          &bull; Describe some of the confounding variables found in typical tests used to assess APD in children by 
          speech-language pathologists, OTs, psychologists and educational specialists<br />
          &bull; State for whom specific accommodations like FM systems are appropriate<br />
          &bull; Describe at least one activity that can be used in each of the seven different categories of APD</p>
      </blockquote>
