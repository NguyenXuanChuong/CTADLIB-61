        <p class="bold purple">ASL SEMANTICS: Precision of Expression in ASL</p>
        <p class="inline">Semantics is defined as the study of meanings expressed by the elements of a language or a combination of the elements. A concept
expressed in an ASL sign often cannot be conveyed by a single all-purpose English word. Likewise, English words and phrases
may have variations in meaning, which require translations using different ASL signs. This workshop helps students advance their
skills in translating from ASL to English and from English to ASL.</p>
