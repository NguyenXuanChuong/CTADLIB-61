        This workshop is designed to help health care professionals gain enhanced
          self-knowledge, increase their options 
        for action and coping, and help them improve inter-personal communications
        and their own personal focus. 
        Participants find that doing the exercises taught, on a regular basis,
        reduces stress and enhances satisfaction both in 
        and out of the workplace. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction techniques
        mobilize mind/body resources to work 
        with stress, pain, and illness in ways that promote growth and healing.<br />
        <br />
        Methodology includes guided stress management exercises and discussion
      geared toward the health care professionals.</p>
