      <span class="style62">  SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:</span> <span class="style62"><br />
          </span> <span class="style62">This 1 day workshop is designed for professionals who serve children with complex feeding aversions/disorders in hospital, school and private practice settings. Focus is placed on a comprehensive holistic evaluation of these complex problems including those encountered by children with structural issues, cardiac issues, prematurity, Autism, Syndromes, GI issues, sensory integration disorders, Down Syndrome as well as on a holistic treatment approach for common feeding disorders that are characteristic of many of these children including rigid eating patterns, inability to regulate their own hunger/satiety, difficulty transitioning to table foods and/or tube dependency, lack of autonomy. In addition to innovative effective treatment techniques, participants will learn the criteria to determine what intensity of therapy is warranted.<br /><br />
          Many case studies with videos will be used to illustrate the complex nature of these children. Instructional methods include case studies with discussion and videos, lectures and handouts.<br />
          </span><span class="style62"><br />
            Participants will be able to:<br />
            &bull; Identify elements that interfere with normal eating<br />
            &bull; Identify children who are appropriate and ready for oral functional therapy<br />
            &bull; Perform a holistic evaluation for complex feeding problems<br />
            &bull; Identify the barriers to normal eating patterns and potential treatment goals<br />
            &bull; Develop a holistic treatment approach including determining the appropriate intensity of therapy<br />(including issues of timing as to when to use resources differently)<br />
