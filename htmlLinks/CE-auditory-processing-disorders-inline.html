      	<p><span style="color: #5A664F;font-size: 10px;font-family: Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">OVERVIEW:<br>This course is designed to help therapists and teachers understand the current research and management
approaches for auditory processing disorders [(C)APD] as evident in children on the autism spectrum (ASD) and
children with other developmental learning issues. The instructor will review new neuroscience research that
helps us understand how the brain processes auditory information like speech, as well as causative factors
known to contribute to (C)APD in children. The course will review tests that can be used by SLPs, OTs, and
teachers to identify children at risk for APD as well as checklists that parents and therapists can use with young
children. In addition, characteristics that distinguish APD from ADHD and ADD will be reviewed with a discussion
of ADHD medications and their long-term effects. Practical suggestions for managing each of these disorders
will be offered. The course will conclude with a presentation of evidence-based interventions from several
sources, which have been shown to improve auditory processing and to affect brain function.</span></p>
