      <span class="style62">SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:</span> <span class="style62"><br />
          </span> <span class="style62">Within the past few years the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders have become clearer. As the term ASD suggests, autism is not a unitary disorder, but a complex syndrome with as many differing manifestations as there are experts to talk about them. As the genetics of autism is becoming better understood, so are the effects the genes have on brain development and maturation.<br />
          <br />
          This course will review the current research on the biology and neurology of ASD, genetic and environmental factors, and effective treatment approaches including specific emphasis on the development of the perception, mirror neuron mechanisms and Theory of Mind. One full day of the course will focus on assessment and treatment approaches. New research on early identification of ASD in infants will be followed by specific evidence-based intervention approaches for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and school-aged children. This course is appropriate for OT&rsquo;s, PT&rsquo;s, SLP&rsquo;s and educators.<br />
          </span><span class="style62"><br />
            Participants will be able to:<br />
            &bull; Utilize new genetic, environmental, behavioral and perceptual research to assess cognitive, perceptual and motor components of ASD<br />
            &bull; Identify behaviors in infants that place them at risk for autism spectrum disorders<br />
            &bull; Develop preventative interventions for young children<br />
            &bull; Develop effective interventions for school-age children and adolescents with ASD based on the new research<br />
            <br />
