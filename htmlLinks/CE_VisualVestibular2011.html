<span class="style53">COURSE DESCRIPTION:</span>
          <span class="style4"><br />
          The course examines the role of sensory-motor development and visual-vestibular integration in the development of
attention, modulation, visual perception and social skills. Participants will learn to recognize the subtle signs of visual
and vestibular dysfunction that significantly impact social skills and school performance. These signs are often the keys
to designing effective treatment for improved sensory processing, motor skills and behavior in children with a variety
of diagnoses.<br /><br />
Discussion will include biochemical/metabolic issues, assessment techniques including screening tools for behavioral
vision issues, innovative treatment techniques, and strategies for sharing information with parents and teachers.
Extensive video case analysis of infants, toddlers and school children will be presented.
</span>
        <span class="style4"><br />
        <br />
        Participants will be able to:<br />
  &bull; Analyze the role of sensory processing in the development of attention, social skills and visual perception.<br />
  &bull; Identify subtle signs of visual-vestibular and other sensory-motor dysfunction<br />
  &bull; Apply integrated assessment techniques and develop measurable goals<br />
  &bull; Identify “red flags” that warrant referral to a behavioral vision specialist<br />
  &bull; Develop effective treatment protocols for the clinic and school<br />
  &bull; Implement strategies for sharing information with parents and teachers for optimal outcomes.<br />
        <br />
