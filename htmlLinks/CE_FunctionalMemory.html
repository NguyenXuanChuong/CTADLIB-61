      <span class="style53">SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:</span>
<span class="style4">The course will review the psychology and neurology of memory and memory
    disorders in children and adolescents with language and motor planning disorders. The presenter will
    review new research on the organization of memory and how treatment approaches can utilize this new
    research to enhance both processes of learning. The presentation will also include a section on post concussion
    syndrome seen in children with mild head injuries and will focus on compensatory approaches for
    aiding retention in children with language and motor planning problems where memory problems interfere
    with the therapeutic process.</span>
        <span class="style4"><br />
        <br />
        Participants will be able to:<br />
          &bull; Distinguish the neurological processes which underlie memory disturbances and differentiate from those which
underlie the performance of attention, inferencing, and problem-solving.<br />
          &bull; Develop methods for functional memory assessment and differential diagnosis for children and adolescents<br />
          &bull; Apply treatment approaches for a variety of memory disturbances in language, ASD and neurologically impaired
children and adolescents.<br />
      <br />
