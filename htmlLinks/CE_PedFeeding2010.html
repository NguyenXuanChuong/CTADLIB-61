      <div align="justify"><span class="style61">SEMINAR DESCRIPTION:</span> <span class="style54">This two day workshop is designed for professionals who serve children with complex 
        feeding aversions/disorders in hospitals, school and private practice settings. The first day of the workshop focuses on 
        a comprehensive holistic evaluation of these complex problems, including those encountered by children with structural 
        issues, cardiac issues, prematurity, Autism, Syndromes, GI issues, sensory integration disorders and Down 
        Syndrome. Day two focuses on a holistic treatment approach for common feeding disorders that are characteristic of 
        many of these children, including rigid eating patterns, inability to regulate their own hunger/satiety, difficulty transitioning 
        to table foods and/or tube dependency, lack of autonomy. In addition to innovative effective treatment techniques, 
        participants will learn the criteria to determine what the intensity of therapy warranted in each situation.<br />
        <br />
        Instructional methodologies presented will include case studies with discussion and videos, lectures and handouts.<br />
        <br />
        Participants will:<br />
&bull; Identify elements that interfere with normal eating<br />
&bull; Identify children who are appropriate and ready for oral function therapy<br />
&bull; Be able to perform holistic evaluation for complex feeding problems<br />
&bull; Identify the barriers to normal eating patterns and potential treatment goals<br />
&bull; Be able to develop a holistic treatments approach including determining the appropriate
        intensity of therapy (including issues of timing as to when to use resources differently)</span><span class="style37"><span class="style54"><br />
