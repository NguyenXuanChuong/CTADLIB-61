      <span class="style2">Finally, at long last, it&rsquo;s summer, a time to
      reflect on a school year in which we, staff and consultants, met the demands<br />
of numerous new contracts and to prepare for the challenges and opportunities
that may present themselves as we<br />
continue to grow.<br />
Up and running is our updated Comprehensive Network website, www.comprehensivenet.com,
clean, sleek, and<br />
easy to navigate &ndash; providing our consultants and clients with easy access
to all we have to offer. Also, already three<br />
months in progress, is our &ldquo;Meet Your Comprehensive&trade; Colleague&rdquo; feature,
introducing staff members to one<br />
another, so that you will, hopefully, recognize each other in the street &ndash; or
at least at the next company party.</span></td>

      pg.<br />
      3), Program Manager of our No Child Left Behind (NCLB)<br />
      Supplementary Educational Services (SES), which was<br />
      recently awarded two (2) new contracts, BiNet&reg;, Inc. and<br />
      Comprehensive Enrichment&reg;, one to provide tutoring<br />
      services in Pasco County, FL and the other to three counties<br />
      in Connecticut! Way to go Ana!<br />
      <br />
      Our former staff member, Shanyn Meiner, who had<br />
      moved to Miami, Florida last June, recently visited her old<br />
      friends and colleagues at our NY Headquarters with her<br />
      beautiful son, Matisyahu. We are very pleased that<br />
      Shanyn will be joining our Florida operations in<br />
      September! We are sure that all you Floridian NCLB<br />
      instructors will enjoy working with her.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="style4">With the growth of our SES program, Comprehensive&trade;<br />
      continues its national expansion</span> &ndash; currently providing<br />
      SES services in NYC, Florida, Washington DC and now<br />
      Connecticut. Next? We&rsquo;ll let you know.<br />
      <br />
      Once you recognize the faces, it would be interesting to<br />
      know what your colleagues do &ndash; hence, the creation of<br />
      our Comprehensive&trade; affiliate or division newsletter. The<br />
      various affiliates will each take a turn letting us in on the<br />
      latest developments, activities and accomplishments in<br />
      their particular domain. This interchange will serve to not<br />
      only let to know what various divisions do and whom they<br />
      serve, but also provide you with an opportunity to share<br />
      ideas and best methods with one another.<br />
      <br />
      <span class="style4">The first issue, scheduled for August, was created by<br />
    Netcare&reg;, Inc.,</span> a participating company of Comprehensive&trade;,<br /></td>
    <td width="380" valign="top" class="style2">providing Early Intervention services. If you are not familiar<br />
with Early Intervention, what it does or whom it serves,<br />
read the newsletter or go to our new updated website.<br />
<br />
We don&rsquo;t want to steal their thunder, but would like to<br />
take the opportunity to congratulate Netcare&reg; on the<br />
recent renewal of their NYC Department of Health and<br />
Mental Hygiene contract, adding Service Coordination to<br />
its treatment and assessment services. To accommodate<br />
this growing affiliate, we added to and established larger<br />
offices in the Bronx.<br />
<br />
<span class="style4">And there are more updates!</span> It has been a very successful<br />
and very busy year for everyone fulfilling our<br />
Department of Education contracts for the provision of<br />
OTs, PTs, SLPs, etc. Recently, their work has expanded to<br />
coordinating assessments, as well as therapy services,<br />
and the flow of 
activities is continuing 
right 
through the<br />
summer.</td>

      Network&trade;, Inc. (an affiliate of Comprehensive&trade;<br />
and provider of English and bilingual psychological and speech assessments),<br />
DRG Resources Group&trade;, Inc. (a Comprehensive&trade; affiliate and provider
of OT<br />
and PT assessments), Marlene, the Related Services staff and our affiliated<br />
assessment consultants for stepping up to the task &mdash; and to Cheyn for stepping
down (from the second floor to the first floor) to temporarily help out.<br />
<br />
Comprehensive&trade; has also increased its marketing efforts on behalf of its<br />
participating companies, Comprehensive Resources&reg;, Inc and SignTalk&reg;,<br />
providers of nurses and sign language interpreters, respectively.<br />
<br />
And the results are showing. Bilingual Professional Agency&trade;, Inc., a<br />
participating company of Comprehensive&trade; and a SignTalk&reg; affiliate,
was<br />
recently awarded a contract by the New York City Department of Health and<br />
Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), as well as new agreements with several organizations,
including the NYU Medical Center, National Multiple Sclerosis<br />
Society, Chase Manhattan Bank, HIP of Greater New York, and the Internal<br />
Revenue Service (IRS), among others.<br />
<br />
In an effort to rise to the challenge of our new demands, this summer we<br />
are focused on promoting efficiency, organization, productivity and teamwork.<br />
Our goal is to keep a productive family atmosphere and support one<br />
another, personally and professionally, in all our endeavors.<br />
<br />
In addition to our professional positive attitude, many of our staff members<br />
have embraced a personal Mind Over Body&reg; mindset as well by participating<br />
in nutritional programs that include healthy eating and exercise. The<br />
orders of pizza and fries have been replaced by salads, fish and lots of<br />
water. Brenda Yagmin, Director of Operations, will run her first 13 mile<br />
marathon on July 27.<br />
<br />
Not familiar with Mind Over Body&reg;? Well, that was our first company name<br />
and focused on weight control and healthy life styles &ndash; and our first registered<br />
trademark (For more information on the registration marks affixed to<br />
our various affiliated companies, see box on right). Both the company and<br />
concept still exist. In fact, our Comprehensive Enrichment&reg; Professional<br />
Enrichment Program is scheduling a workshop on Mindfullness Based<br />
Stress Reduction (MBSR), a pain and stress reduction training using meditation,
mindful yoga and relaxation techniques to mobilize our mind/body<br />
resources to promote growth and healing. This workshop will be made<br />
available to all consultants, regardless of discipline.<br />
<br />
Finally, we recently sent out an announcement asking the staff to review our<br />
new website and provide us with their feedback. Some of you caught errors<br />
that we all missed! In that light, I would like to announce two special new<br />
initiatives for the summer, for both consultants and staff:<br />
<br />
<span style="padding-left:5px">1. MIND OVER BODY&reg; CHALLENGE &ndash; mail me your achievements, whether</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:15px">they are related to your health, education, or family &mdash; anything you would</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:15px">like to share with the Comprehensive&trade; family and include in</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:20px">our next newsletter.</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:80px">2. NEW SITE FEEDBACK &ndash; As mentioned above, we</span><br />
<span style="padding-left:100px">appreciate your feedback. Please take a few minutes and </span><br />
<span style="padding-left:110px">visit our newly designed company website and send your </span><br />

        conflicts with other brands to<br />
        determine when they are<br />
        genuinely unique, prior to<br />
        awarding a Registered<br />

DO YOU VISIT AND HOW MANY AIRLINE MILES DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE LOGGED?</span><br />
In addition to New York, I have worked in 3 other states: Florida, Maryland,

miles.<br />
<br />

I began in the Nursing program assisting Lynette the Director. Then, I was asked
to<br />
organize and develop the Tutoring program in its infancy and have been there
ever since.<br />
<br />
<span class="style4">WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PART OF WORKING FOR COMPREHENSIVE?</span><br />
Being able to see a child go from one level to the next because of the tutoring
program is my <br />
favorite part of the job.
The fact that I am working in such a business yet family oriented <br />
environment
while I get to do this is icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
<span class="style4">TELL US ONE ACHIEVEMENT OF WHICH YOU ARE MOST PROUD.</span><br />
Bringing the company national!<br />
<br />
<span class="style4">IS THERE A PHRASE OR SONG OR EVENT THAT GUIDES (HAS GUIDED) OR INFLUENCES (INFLUENCED)
YOU?</span><br />
Barbara Streisand's A Piece of the Sky. This song represents that there is more
to the world than just looking through a<br />
window, if you step outside, there is so much more to see and be.<br />
<em>Tell me where<br />
Where is it written<br />
What is it I meant to be?<br />
That I can't dare...<br />
It all began the day I found..<br />
That from my window I could only see<br />
A piece of sky.<br />
I stepped outside and looked around.<br />
I never dreamed it was so wide<br />
Or even half as high.<br />
The time had come</em><br />

strong.<br />

M.<br />
<br />
